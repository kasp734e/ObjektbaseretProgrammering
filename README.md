## Lektion 1 
### Exercise 1
Now in the main function of exercise_1.cpp:
Define a variable of type intcalled weightassume the unit is [kg]
Define a variable of type doublecalled heightassume the unit is [m]
Initialize to suitable values
Define a variable of type doublecalled bmiand initialize it to weight/height2
Then write
bmi for weight:<weight> and height:<height> is <the result>
to the console output.
Vary the height and weight values set height=0 and observe

### Exercise 2
In the file exercise_2.cpp, implement the following in the mainfunction:
Define a variable angleof type doubleinitialized to some value less than 2*pi
Define a variable xof type doubleinitialized cos(angle)
Define a variable yof type doubleinitialized sin(angle)
Define a variable lengthof type doubleinitialized to the length of (x,y)
Write the length to the console
Vary angle and observe the length value. What is it you are calculating?
Hint: Lengthis defined as sqrt(x2+y2), include <cmath> to implement this
